## Networking

Create an implementation of [Gomoku (Five in a row)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) that allows remote players to start or join games. The application will contain two parts (create a project for each one):
* The **server** is responsible with the game management and mediating the players.
* The **client** will communicate with the server, sending it *commands* such as:
    * create or join a game,
    * submit a move, etc.
