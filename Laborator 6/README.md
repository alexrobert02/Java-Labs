## Graphical User Interfaces (Swing, JavaFX)

Consider a [positional game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_game) played on board containing a number of *dots* placed on a circle. Some dots are connected to other dots using *lines*. Initially, the existing lines are gray (not colored).  
Two players take turns coloring any uncolored lines. One player colors in one color (red), and the other colors in another color (blue).
* Variant 1: Each player tries to create a triangle made solely of his color. The player who succeeds, wins the game.
* Variant 2: Each player tries to avoid the creation of a triangle made solely of his color. The player who cannot avoid creating such a triangle, loses the game.

In order to create a graphical user interface for the game, you may use either Swing or JavaFX.
