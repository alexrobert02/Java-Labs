## Classes and Interfaces

A social network contains *persons* and *companies*, each of them *identifiable* by unique names.  
In this network there are *relationships* of the following types: person-to-person (if they know each other, how?), and person-to-company (if the person works for that company, on what position?).  
There may be various types of "specialized" persons in the network, such as *programmers* or *designers*.
